						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">

								<li>Many times i got to a company and heard exaggerated business requirements like 99.99% uptime, no data loss tolerated, etc. This causes over-engineering and overly complex systems which are less reliable in practive</li>

								<li>It's not enough to have the tools, you need to use them effectively</li>
								<li>Your telemetry might not provide the information you need</li>
								<li>Are you comfortable and productive with the tools?</li>
								<li>Rarely used skills (e.g. recovering from backups) need to be applieds in time pressing situations</li>
								<li>Test possible plans, measure the time it takes to execute them and their effects. Use this data to build DR plans and investigation runbooks when you have time to properly plan</li>

						<h2>Simulate disasters</h2>
						<h3>Systems exhibit different behaviour under stress</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Different operation procedures</li>
							<li>Some bugs/behaviours manifest only in abnormal conditions</li>
							<li>Faulty fallback syndrome</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>The systems behaves differently when things are broken</li>
								<li>You want to have graceful degradation</li>
								<li>We can only learn about behaviours through real-world incidents and simulation</li>
								<li>I've seen many fallbacks that failed during incidents because to the faulty fallback syndrom. The problem is that fallbacks are often tested on normal conditions and rarely used in prodcution; But fallbacks are needed the most when the system is under load and broken and therefor fail. An example of this is master slave RDBMS failover without warmup</li>
